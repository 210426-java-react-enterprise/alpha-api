# alpha-api
A Weather Application API

Alphacast is a service for anyone who's ever been stuck at a rained out ball game or turned up to a beach party and been told no one can get in the water due to thunder. It combines the utility of the OpenWeatherMap API and the Seatgeek API to keep you abreast of not only the hottest events in your area but also how hot your area is. Users have the ability to see the weather and events for any given city as well as set their hometown for a streamlined experience. Users can see both the hourly weather for the day or get a seven day forecast. With both email and text notifications knowing how to dress for your hotly anticipated outing has never been more convenient. This is the API end point that our [User Interface](https://github.com/210426-java-react-enterprise/alpha-ui) utilizes.
# Project 2

Technology frameworks Used:

[ ] Java API will use Hibernate to communicate with a PostGreSQL RDBMS 

[ ] Java API will leverage the Spring Framework 

[ ] Java API will be RESTful (no `HttpSession`, use JWTs!)

[ ] Complete CI/CD pipelines will use AWS (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Elastic Beanstalk, and S3)

[ ] PostGreSQL RDBMS for persistence 

[ ] API built with Java 8 and Spring 5

[ ] UI built with HTML, CSS, and JS (Using NodeJS is highly encouraged, though React is optional)
 

Other requirements: 

[ ] Application will demonstrate at least ten individual user stories 

[ ] Application will leverage at least one external API 

[ ] Application's own data model must be sufficiently complex (i.e. >2 tables) 

[ ] RDBMS will be deployed to the cloud (AWS RDS) 

[ ] Java API will be deployed to the cloud (AWS EC2) 

[ ] UI application will be deployed to the cloud (AWS S3) 

[ ] Java API will have >=80% test coverage for service layer

[ ] Java API will leverage Spring's MockMvc for integration/e2e tests of controller endpoints

[ ] Java API will be adequately documents (Java Docs and web endpoint documentation [Swagger/OpenAPI])


Suggested bonus goals:

[ ] Deploy API using ECS w/ Docker (instead of Elastic Beanstalk)

[ ] Secure your Java API using Spring Security

[ ] Unit test your UI application's JS using the Jest testing framework

 
## Other Thoughts
The project concepts must be approved by the trainer. Remember to keep user stories clear and unambiguous. Keep in mind that you only have 2 weeks to work on this project so make your MVP something attainable. 
In addition to your project proposal, teams should also structure themselves with one team leader and a person or persons who fulfill the role of Gitflow manager and DevOps engineer.  
Lastly, avoid the temptation to divide work into "API" and "UI", all associates must implement logic on both sides of the stack! 

## Presentations

Presentations will occur on the morning of Monday, June 14th, 2021. 
All team members must have a speaking role in the presentation of the application, and a PowerPoint slideshow is encouraged to accompany your presentation.
